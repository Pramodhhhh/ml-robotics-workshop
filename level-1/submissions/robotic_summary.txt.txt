Robots are programmable machines designed to perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously.
The key components of a robot are:
1. Mechanical Structure: This traditional machine design is a parallel of human arm structure composed of cantilevered beams, forming a sequence of arm links connected by hinged joints.
2. Sensors: These devices provide internal and external environmental data essential for feedback and control.
3. Actuators: These drive motion in robot's parts.
4. Controllers: The programmed commands are processed by the controllers to execute tasks accurately.

Applications of robot in real world:

1. Robots(Surgical Robots) are used in surgical fields helping doctors in surgeries. They perform surgeries with high precision.
2. Robots are extensively used for assembly, welding, and material handling on production lines due to their precision and ability to adapt to flexible production requirements.
3. Robots, such as Mars rovers, explore uninhabitable environments, analyze terrain, and conduct scientific research where human presence is impossible.
